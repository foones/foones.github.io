<h2>Software</h2>

<p>I have been involved in the development of <a href="https://github.com/foones/gbs">PyGobstones</a> (2011&ndash;2012)
and <a href="https://github.com/gobstones/gobstones-interpreter">Gobstones Web</a> (2017&ndash;2018). These are
free software tools that implement the <a href="http://www.gobstones.org/">Gobstones</a> programming language.</p>

<p>The Gobstones programming language was designed by a group of researchers and teachers
at the University of Quilmes,
lead by Pablo "Fidel" Mart&iacute;nez L&oacute;pez,
to teach students without any previous exposure to programming.</p>

<h2>Reading group</h2>

<p>In 2014 and during 2016&ndash;2019, I coordinated an informal weekly
<a href="https://labandalambda.github.io">reading group</a>
on the lambda-calculus.</p>

<h2>Useless crafts</h2>
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/foones/lenguajes">Programming languages</a>
     that I have implemented throughout the years.
<li> I have spent quite a lot of time attempting to write <a href="http://como-rompe.blogspot.com">poetry</a>.
